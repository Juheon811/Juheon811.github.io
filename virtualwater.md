# Deng et al.(2021): Social network analysis of virtual water trade among major countries in the world
<br><br>
## 💡 1. Research Question and Research Gap

### **What is the structure of the virtual water trade network between major countries in the world?**

Previous studies have primarily focused on virtual water trade related to **agricultural products**. Also, most of them have simply compared the total import and export volumes by country. This study introduces a methodology called **Social Network Analysis** to quantitatively analyze the structural characteristics of virtual water trade and provides an integrated analysis of virtual water trade networks across the entire industrial structure.

<br><br>
## 🌊 2. Introduction

### **Why is virtual water trade important?**

Water is a key resource that supports all industries, agriculture, and daily life. However, the problem is that water is very disproportionately distributed among countries. That’s where the concept of Virtual Water Trade comes in. It refers to the idea that when we trade goods, we are also indirectly trading the water used to produce them. This study shows how virtual water trade plays a role in solving water shortages between countries and explores how the global trade network is connected in terms of virtual water flows.

## 🔧 3. Methods and Data Sources

### 💡 How is *Virtual Water* calculated?

This study estimates inter-country virtual water flows using a **Multi-Regional Input–Output (MRIO) model**.  

#### Direct Water Coefficient

\\[
w_i^r = \frac{W_i^r}{X_i^r}
\\]

- \\(W_i^r\\): Water consumed by industry *i* in country *r*  
- \\(X_i^r\\): Total output of industry *i* in country *r*  
-> how much water is used to produce one unit of output

---

#### Input–Output Balance Equation

\\[
AX + Y = X
\\]

- \\(A\\): Input coefficient matrix (inter-industry consumption)  
- \\(X\\): Total output vector  
- \\(Y\\): Final demand vector  
-> Total output equals intermediate + final consumption

---

#### Leontief Inverse Matrix

\\[
X = (I - A)^{-1}Y = LY
\\]

- \\(L = (I - A)^{-1}\\): Leontief inverse matrix  
-> Both direct and indirect production requirements

---

#### Virtual Water Trade Matrix

\\[
H = \hat{W} \cdot L \cdot Z
\\]

- \\(\hat{W}\\): Diagonal matrix of direct water coefficients  
- \\(L\\): Leontief inverse  
- \\(Z\\): Final goods traded between countries  
-> estimate indirect virtual water flows across borders

---

#### Virtual Water Network Matrix

\\[
T = H
\\]

- \\(t_{rs}\\): Virtual water *exported* from country *r* to country *s*  
-> Off-diagonal elements show bilateral virtual water trade

---

## 📊 4. Network Analysis: How Virtual Water Trade is Structured

To analyze the structure of the virtual water trade, this study applies **social network metrics**:

---

#### Density (Network Connectivity)

\\[
D = \frac{\sum_{r \neq s} \sum_{s=1}^{m} t_{rs}}{m(m - 1)}
\\]

- Measures how densely connected the virtual water network is  
- Higher values = more active trade across countries

---

#### Asymmetry (Trade Imbalance)

\\[
S = \frac{\sum_{r \neq s} \sum_{s=1}^{m} |t_{rs} - t_{sr}|}{m(m - 1)}
\\]

- Capture the imbalance between exports and imports  
- High values = unidirectional or one-sided trade

---

#### Out-Degree (Virtual Water Exports)

\\[
OD_r = \sum_{s \neq r} t_{rs}
\\]

- Total virtual water exported by country r 
- Indicates water-exporting hubs

---

#### In-Degree (Virtual Water Imports)

\\[
ID_r = \sum_{s \neq r} t_{sr}
\\]

- Total virtual water imported into country r 
- High values suggest greater water dependency

---

## 🎯 5. Result and Interpretation

Global virtual water trade has continuously increased from 2006 to 2015. Both virtual water exports and imports increased significantly from 2006 to 2015, showing a clear growth in global trade among major countries.

**<Network by Out-Degree (2015)>**  
![Out-Degree Network](/img/posts/fig2.png)

The Out-Degree network shows countries that exported large amounts of virtual water to others.
China and India had the largest outflows, shown by the largest node sizes and thick outbound links.
This indicates that these countries acted as central suppliers in the global virtual water trade network.


**<Network by In-Degree (2015)>**  
![In-Degree Network](/img/posts/fig3.png)

The In-Degree network focuses on countries with high virtual water imports.
The United States and Japan had the biggest consumers, shown by the largest node sizes and thick incoming links.
These countries had strong dependencies on foreign water resources embedded in traded goods.

---

## 📍 6. Conclusions

Virtual water trade can be an important way to reduce water resource differences between countries around the world
Using Social Network Analysis, this study identifies key structural features of virtual water flows and highlights central players in the trade network.
As a result of the analysis, China is a major exporter and the United States is a major importer, serving as a key hub for the virtual water network.
In particular, virtual water trade was the most active in the agricultural sector, suggesting that trade strategies in the agricultural sector are important in policy.

## A Network Analysis of Global Wine🍷 and Beer🍺 Trade


## 📦 Data Introduction
---
#### Data Sources
The dataset was obtained from the [FAOSTAT](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data) platform.
FAOSTAT is an official platform of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) that provides free access to global food and agriculture statistics.
It covers over 245 countries and territories and includes long-term data starting from 1961.
For this project, I used trade data to analyze virtual water flows related to wine and beer.
Node-level information was constructed using population, GDP per capita, and foreign direct investment (FDI) datasets.
  
---
#### Major Characteristics of the Data

1. Time Range (1990–2023)  
   - The dataset covers global trade from 1990 to 2023.  
   - This allows for a long-term analysis of how virtual water flows have changed over time, especially in the trade of wine and beer.
     
---

2. Focus on Selected Items  
   - Two beverage-related items were selected from FAOSTAT trade data:  
     - Wine  
     - Beer of barley, malted
       
---

3. Edge Data
   - Based on FAOSTAT’s detailed bilateral trade matrix.  
   - Each trade record includes reporter/partner country, reporter/partner code, year, item, unit, and trade value.  
   - Trade flows were filtered with the following conditions:  
     - Year: 1990–2023  
     - Final Value > 1000 (to retain only meaningful trade relationships)
       
---

4. Node Data 
   - The following three datasets were merged to construct the node attributes:

     - `Population_E_All_Data_(Normalized).csv`  
       -> Selected element: `Total Population - Both sexes`

     - `Macro-Statistics_Key_Indicators_E_All_Data_(Normalized).csv`  
       -> Selected element: `Value US$ per capita (GDP per Capita)`

     - `Investment_ForeignDirectInvestment_E_All_Data_(Normalized).csv`  
       -> Selected item: `Total FDI inflows`, element: `Value US$`

   - These attributes add demographic, economic, and investment information to each country node.
     
---

#### Data Pre-processing

**1. Link** <br>
Filter by Export/Import and Items <br>
Focus only on two beverage products: Wine and Beer made from barley, malted. <br>
Filter the dataset to include only export and import records with positive values.


```python
# Export data
link2 = link[(link['Element'] == 'Export quantity') & (link['weight'] > 0)]
items_export = link2[(link2['item'] == 'Wine') | (link2['item'] == 'Beer of barley, malted')]

# Import data
link3 = link[(link['Element'] == 'Import quantity') & (link['weight'] > 0)]
items_import = link3[(link3['item'] == 'Wine') | (link3['item'] == 'Beer of barley, malted')]
``` 


Merge Export & Import <br>
Merge export and import datasets on matching country pairs, items, and years. <br>
Calculate the Final Value by choosing the larger of export and import values for each trade pair.


```python
link_merge = pd.merge(items_export, items_import,
    on=["O_code", "O_name", "D_code", "D_name", "item", "year"],
    how='inner')

link_merge["Final Value"] = np.where(link_merge["weight_x"] > link_merge["weight_y"],
                                     link_merge["weight_x"], link_merge["weight_y"])
``` 
---

**2. Node** <br>
Merge the three datasets


```python
# Merge Population and GDP
node_df = pop1.merge(macro1, on=["country", "country_code", "Year"], how="inner")

# Merge with FDI data
node_df = node_df.merge(fdi1, on=["country", "country_code", "Year"], how="inner")

# Choose final columns
node_df = node_df[["country", "country_code", "Year", "population", "GDP", "FDI"]]
node_df
```

## 📈 Analysis
---
#### Density Plot

<iframe src="/assets/wine_beer_density.html" width="950" height="700" style="border:none;"></iframe>
---

- Wine (red line): The network density of wine has been steadily increasing since the early 1990s. It shows a continuous trend of increasing overall. In particular, it has shown a sharp increase since 2020, indicating that wine is emerging as a major central item in the virtual water resource trade. This means that wine-producing countries are actively trading with various countries, forming tighter trade networks. <br>
- Beer (blue line): Beer has seen a rather modest increase since the mid-1990s, maintaining a lower network density than wine. Although it has increased somewhat since 2020, it is still lower than wine. This means that it is an item with relatively less trade connectivity. <br>
- Overall interpretation:  The marked increase in network density since 2020 for both wine and beer reflects the impact of boosting global trade and improving logistics infrastructure. Wine maintains trade relations with more countries, suggesting it is positioned as a central item in the virtual water flow.
