# 💡 1. Research Question and Research Gap

### 🔍 **What is the structure of the virtual water trade network between major countries in the world?**

Previous studies have primarily focused on virtual water trade related to **agricultural products**.  
Also, most of them have simply compared the total import and export volumes by country.

This study introduces a methodology called **🌐 Social Network Analysis**  
to quantitatively analyze the structural characteristics of virtual water trade,  
and provides an integrated analysis of virtual water trade networks across the **entire industrial structure**.

# 🌊 2. Introduction

### ❓ **Why is virtual water trade important?**

Water is a **key resource** that supports all industries, agriculture, and daily life.  
However, the problem is that water is very **disproportionately distributed** among countries.

That’s where the concept of **💧 Virtual Water Trade** comes in.  
It refers to the idea that when we trade goods,  
we’re also **indirectly trading the water** used to produce them.

This study shows how virtual water trade plays a role in  
**🛠️ solving water shortages** between countries,  
and explores how the **🌐 global trade network** is connected in terms of virtual water flows.
