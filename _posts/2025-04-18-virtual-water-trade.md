## 1. Research Question and Research Gap

**What is the structure of the virtual water trade network between major countries in the world?**

Previous studies have primarily focused on virtual water trade related to agricultural products.  
Also, most of them have simply compared the total import and export volumes by country.

This study introduces a methodology called **Social Network Analysis** to quantitatively analyze the structural characteristics of virtual water trade  
and provides an integrated analysis of virtual water trade networks across the **entire industrial structure**.

## 2. Introduction

**Why is virtual water trade important?**

Water is a key resource that supports all industries, agriculture, and daily life.  
However, the problem is water is very **disproportionately distributed** among countries.

That’s where the concept of **Virtual Water Trade** comes in.  
It refers to the idea that when we trade goods, we’re also **indirectly trading the water** used to produce them.

This study shows how virtual water trade plays a role in **solving water shortages** between countries  
and explores how the **global trade network** is connected in terms of virtual water flows.
