In the previous post on community analysis in California counties, migration patterns were examined and a network was constructed. This post extends the analysis by applying the MR-QAP method.

## ‚ùì MR-QAP

Multiple Regression Quadratic Assignment Procedure (MR-QAP) is a specialized regression analysis method designed to analyze network data. Traditional regression analysis operates on the assumption that each data point is independent of each other, but network data is not. For example, the number of people moving from county A to county B can be affected by the movement from county A to county A or their relationship with other counties, so all observations have an interdependent structure. Because of these characteristics, applying general regression analysis as it is can significantly reduce statistical reliability.


To address these issues, MR-QAP performs a regression analysis between the dependent and independent variable matrices, and then evaluates the significance of the regression results using a permutation-based test. A permutation test is a method of randomly mixing rows and columns of a dependent variable matrix, repeating the same regression analysis thousands of times to create a random distribution, and then comparing how extreme the actual regression results are in that distribution. This allows you to calculate the p-value and test whether the influence of that variable is statistically significant. 


This method is particularly effective when dealing with data on relationships in matrix form, such as population movement between regions, social networks, and interactions between organizations. In this analysis, MR-QAP was used to evaluate what socioeconomic factors might explain population movement between 58 counties in California.

## üì¶ Data Introduction

#### Data Sources

**1. County shapefile**  
`COUNTY_2019_US_SL050_Coast_Clipped.shp`  
Used to get county boundaries and calculate distances between centroids.

**2. Socioeconomic data**  
`R13859119_SL050.csv` with `R13859119.txt`  
Includes population, income, education, unemployment, race, and commute time.  
Used to compare differences between counties.

**3. Migration flow data**  
`county-to-county-2016-2020-ins-outs-nets-gross.xlsx`  
Filtered for California-only flows (weight > 50).  
Used to build the migration network for MR-QAP.

#### Data Pre-processing

**1. Link** 

Read the "California" sheet from the Excel file and select the first 9 columns

```python
link = pd.read_excel('county-to-county-2016-2020-ins-outs-nets-gross.xlsx', sheet_name='California', skiprows=2)
link = link.iloc[:, 0:9]
link.columns = [
    'O_state_cd', 'O_county_cd', 'D_state_cd', 'D_county_cd',
    'O_state_nm', 'O_county_nm', 'D_state_nm', 'D_county_nm', 'weight'
]
```

Filter only within-California migration flows greater than 50

```python
link2 = link[
    (link['O_state_nm'] == 'California') &
    (link['D_state_nm'] == 'California') &
    (link['weight'] > 50)
]
```

Convert code columns to integer type

```python
link2['O_state_cd'] = link2['O_state_cd'].astype(int)
link2['O_county_cd'] = link2['O_county_cd'].astype(int)
link2['D_state_cd'] = link2['D_state_cd'].astype(int)
link2['D_county_cd'] = link2['D_county_cd'].astype(int)
```


**2. Node** 

Load socioeconomic data and filter for California counties

```python
node = pd.read_csv('R13859119_SL050.csv')
node = node[node['Geo_STATE'] == 6]
```

Select relevant variables

```python
node2 = node[[
    'Geo_FIPS',
    'Geo_QName',
    'Geo_STATE',
    'Geo_COUNTY',
    'SE_A00001_001',  # Total population
    'SE_A03001_002',  # White Alone
    'SE_A03001_003',  # Black Alone
    'SE_A03001_005',  # Asian Alone
    'SE_A00002_002',  # Population density
    'SE_A12001_005',  # Bachelor's degree
    'SE_A17005_003',  # Unemployed
    'SE_A14006_001',  # Median household income
    'SE_A09003_001'   # Average commute time
]]
```

## üß≠ California County-to-County Migration Network

The migration network is built using filtered flow data between counties.  
Only flows with more than 50 people are included to reduce noise.


Create the directed weighted graph

```python
g = nx.from_pandas_edgelist(link2, source='O_county_cd', target='D_county_cd', edge_attr='weight')
```

Add node attributes

```python
node_attr = node2.set_index('Geo_COUNTY').to_dict('index')
nx.set_node_attributes(g, node_attr)
```

Calculate degree

```python
degree_dict = dict(g.degree(weight='weight'))
nx.set_node_attributes(g, degree_dict, 'degree')
```

## üìê Preparing the MR-QAP Model

üîΩ Dependent Variable (Migration Flows)
The dependent variable is a 58√ó58 matrix showing how many people moved between each pair of counties in California from 2016 to 2020.
To focus on meaningful movements, we removed flows of 50 people or fewer.
This matrix was created from the migration network using nx.to_numpy_array().
In total, it captures over 1.17 million migration events.

üîº Independent Variables (Attribute Differences)
The independent variables are also 58√ó58 matrices.
Each one shows how different two counties are in a specific attribute, such as income, population, race, or unemployment.

```python
def variable(var):
    var_diff_mat = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))
    for i, node1 in enumerate(ordered_nodes):
        for j, node2 in enumerate(ordered_nodes):
            if var in g.nodes[node1] and var in g.nodes[node2]:
                var1 = g.nodes[node1][var]
                var2 = g.nodes[node2][var]
                var_diff = abs(var1 - var2)
                var_diff_mat[i, j] = var_diff
            else:
                var_diff_mat[i, j] = np.nan
    return var_diff_mat

var_diff_mat = variable('SE_A14006_001')  # Median household income
var_diff_mat2 = variable('SE_A00001_001') # Total population
var_diff_mat3 = variable('SE_A03001_002') # White Alone
var_diff_mat4 = variable('SE_A03001_003') # Black or African American Alone
var_diff_mat5 = variable('SE_A03001_005') # Asian Alone
var_diff_mat6 = variable('SE_A17005_003') # Unemployed
```

## üìè County-to-County Distance Matrix

```python
Calculate the distance between counties using the centroids of their geographic boundaries.

# distance to network
county['centroid'] = county.geometry.centroid

# an empty graph
dist = nx.Graph()

# save each polygon as a node and get the centroid as an attribute
for index, row in county.iterrows():
    node_id = row['COUNTYFP'] 
    centroid = row['centroid']
    dist.add_node(node_id, geometry=row['geometry'], centroid=(centroid.x, centroid.y))

# Compute distance between every pair and save it as an edge
all_nodes = list(dist.nodes())
for i in range(len(all_nodes)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(all_nodes)):
        node1 = all_nodes[i]
        node2 = all_nodes[j]

        centroid1 = Point(dist.nodes[node1]['centroid'])
        centroid2 = Point(dist.nodes[node2]['centroid'])

        distance = centroid1.distance(centroid2)
        dist.add_edge(node1, node2, weight=distance)
```
